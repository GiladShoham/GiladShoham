    <span>, Oct 23, 2023, React Advanced London</span>
  </summary>
  <div>
What if you could use code the same way you use Netflix or Spotify?

Imagine your entire code base organized as small components on the cloud, where you can import only what you need into any workspace. In fact, you can create an ad hoc workspace where you can use and modify only the components you need and export them back.

In order to use code on demand, components need to be independent entities, which means that they have to include their source code, configuration and dependencies. This allows you to version them independently and import them into small dynamic workspaces which are then made much easier to navigate, setup and build. Independent component versioning also makes for independent teams, because this separates publishing updates from consuming them.

When all your organization’s components are in the cloud, teams can discover them, discuss changes and visualize relationships, making collaboration between teams much simpler.

Alongside its many advantages, this paradigm shift brings about considerable challenges, which may explain why this is not the standard way to manage code today. This talk is about the tools and methodologies required to overcome these challenges.

We all love components on the frontend, but have you tried them on the backend?

In this live coding session, Gilad, Bit's VP R&D, will show you how to compose component-driven microservices using NodeJS, Express and Bit. 

Join him to learn how to:
- Compose 2 component-driven microservices from scratch.
- Easily add, modify, and remove components from your services.
- Share managed components between services to radically speed up backend development. 
- Easily manage dependencies and updates between components and services.
- Gradually build a reusable toolbox of backend components.
- Modify and update components in the context of another service or project.
- Avoid configs and have a smooth dev experience.

Join Gilad, from Bit, as he shares practical insights from helping organizations of various sizes transition from monolithic frontends to micro frontends. Drawing from real-world examples, this talk will explore what worked, what didn’t, and how his team approached breaking down large frontends into modular, scalable components. Attendees will gain a deeper understanding of different approaches like runtime vs. build time composition, the pros and cons of each, and key questions to consider when choosing the right architecture for their needs.

The Ripple Effect: Propagating Updates Across an Endless Graph of Components Dependencies
    </a>
    <span>, June 10, 2024, Geektime Code 2024</span>
  </summary>
  <div>
Component-driven development is an increasingly popular development strategy. It enables autonomous teams to simultaneously deliver components that are independently built and versioned. 

The composition of independent components, from the most elementary ones all the way to full systems, generates large and complex graphs of dependencies. Updating a single component can cause a ‘ripple effect’ where multiple composite components, at different levels of the composition hierarchies, are affected. This talk is about some of the challenges of propagating these updates at scale and proposed solutions, such as:

1. How you can automate updates across a massive dependency graph and still feel safe with your updates (and why SemVer is not enough).
2. How to optimize update propagation times.
3. How to communicate and collaborate over updates like breaking API changes or deprecations.
4. How to gain insights into the relations between your organization’s code components, teams and products
5. How to enforce policies using the organization’s dependency graph.

Implementing such solutions can vastly improve an organization’s dev velocity and product consistency and stability.

Micro Frontend Build time vs Runtime dependencies - a gentle equilibrium
    </a>
    <span>, May 17, 2023, Hodash Dev</span>
  </summary>
  <div>
Microservices architecture has been a popular approach for developing complex backend services, but what about the front-end? Enter micro frontends, an emerging concept that breaks down monolithic front-end code into smaller, more manageable pieces. Each micro frontend is a self-contained unit with its own codebase, development team, and set of dependencies. 
Unlike backend microservices, micro frontends end up being composed into a single frontend application. 

There are two main phases where micro frontends can converge into a single application. Some organizations prefer to compose their micro frontends in the client at runtime, while others choose to bundle them together during the build process. This talk will explore the tradeoff between these approaches, examining factors such as team independence, time to ship to production, safe updates, runtime performance, and bundle optimization. 

I will demonstrate how we combined these approaches in my organization and will share some tools and processes that will allow you to enjoy the benefits of both worlds.

      The Golem Turns On His Creator – How I took home automation too far

  </summary>
  <div>
How smart should you make your house?
    
Ever wished you can automate everything in your home? Really everything?
    
For 5 years I’ve been radically automating my house: It finds my phone and reports its location when I ask, it starts boiling water when my baby starts to cry, and it calls my phone when my spouse calls me downstairs.
    
I won’t lie, it’s pretty awesome.
    
But a smart home is a powerful servant and a dangerous master.
    
My home has become a weapon for my kids against me. It tried to sabotage my marriage. It even made me live in the dark. But I survived.
In this talk, I will share my experience and raw footage of an experiment gone too far. Together we’ll try to create a useful toolbox of does and don’ts for the brave smart home engineer.

More of today's applications are being built from smaller components and modules. However, the workflow around building with smaller components can also generate a lot of overhead. Bit is an open source project which helps developers discover, use and collaborate on shared components while distributing the development process itself.

In this talk I will introduce Bit, talk about the challenges and opportunities of building a core piece of your technology with the community, the challenges of having to play hand in hand with the rapidly-changing open source ecosystem (from Git & NPM to Webpack and React) and share some insights for teams who want to open source some of their projects

Sharing components between apps speeds our development and provides a better experience for our users.The key to effective, scalable code-sharing lies in the architecture and tools we choose.

React encourages us to compose our application's UI from smaller reusable components.

Every button, slider or card is a component while larger elements can be composed out of smaller components to create new applications.

But, what happens when we want to share and reuse these components?

In this talk, we'll dive into this question and learn how different architectures, from multi-repo to monorepo, affect our team's ability to share and reuse components. We'll explore how different tools in the ecosystem play a role in this use case, and learn how Bit can help us isolate and share large numbers of components, making them available to discover, use and develop anywhere in a distributed workflow. The session will include a live coding demo session and Q&A.

I’ll describe the current problems with publishing and adopting APIs, and demonstrate a live demo of integrating GitHub GraphQL into my own project in few minutes by using components pre built by the publisher, without the need of reading any documentation (which as developers we hate doing).

    <p>יש פרקים שאנחנו יודעים שהם יהיו טובים עוד לפני שאנחנו לוחצים על כפתור הרקורד - וזה אחד מהם. הכל התחיל בשיחה קטנה על איזה פרוטוקול חדש שנקרא MCP.</p>
    <p>גלעד שהם (Bit) ולאון מלמוד (Flywire) נכנסו לאולפן וסיפרו איך שלוש אותיות הפכו לסערה בעולם ה-AI. דמיינו שה-LLM שלכם לא רק עונה על שאלות, אלא גם מחפש קבצים בגוגל דרייב, מריץ פקודות על השרת, או אפילו מפעיל את מכונת הקפה שלכם - והכל בלי לכתוב שורת קוד מיותרת.</p>
